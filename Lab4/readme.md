## Executive Summary 
In thin unit, we are going to talk about operating system, working on a programming environment, graphics, and create diagrams. The first module is about exploring operating systems and practice using the command prompt to make a directory (file folder) and then view the directory using your operating system's explorer application. The second module we continue to work on Python using an Integrated Development and Learning Environment or IDLE. Finally, The Graphics module is based on graphic rendering, compression and design to help us create a Vector graphic images.

## Code Examples
### Variable: Variables are just parts of your computer's memory where you store some information.
### Assignment statement: Is a statement that assigns a value to a name or a vairiable.
### Function: A fonction is a block of code that only runs when it is called.
### Three data types: The 3 data types are int(integer numbers). double(decimal numbers), and character(char).

## Graphics
### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Raster graphics are composed of colored pixels arranged to display an image,  Vector graphics in the other hand are made up of paths,
each with a mathecial  formula(vector) that tells the path how it is shaped.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
It is matter because the benefit and advantage of lossless compression are that it allows you to retain the quality of your images
while reducing their file size.
### File Formats
The similarities and differences between jpg, gif and png files. for Simularities PNG supports 8-bit color like GIF, but also supports 24-bit color RGB, like JPG does. They are alson non-lossy files, compressing photographic images without degrading image quality. However they are different from one another. JPG uses lossy compression algorithm and image may lost some of its data whereas GIF uses lossless compression algorithm and no image data loss is presenent in GIFformat, And PNG are better suited for images involving text, Charts, screenshorts and detailed illustrations. 


### File Properties
the information that can be found about the file properties are: the type of the file, the file's location, the size of the file,
the file's size in the disk, the date the file has been created and modified. and the attributes.

## Conclusion
To sum up, we learned a lot in this chapter. I am getting use to writing program in Python, I know about variable, function, object and data types. I also can make the difference between JPG, PNG, and GIF files. I know how to create a graphic image such as a logo. Moreover I learned about image file compression and file properties. By the time we finish this course , I will definitely be ready to do hands on practice in this IT branch.

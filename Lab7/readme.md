## Executive Summary 
This chapter is intended to explore and learn about 3 modules. The first module is folder and file compression. A compressing file is a decrease of 
the file's size. That will also reduce the amount of space they occupied on your drive or removable storage devices. We also learn about the second module which is
Python OOP (object-oriented programming). Talking about OOP in Python refers to a set of concepts and patterns using to solve problems with object.
Finally in the last module we will explore Object Oriented Programming Concepts and how it can be used to define classes. We are going use Lucid chart to practice creating a class diagram.  
## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is making the computer files to occupy less pace on your computer by reducing the size of the file.  File compression packs data into a smaller digit form. It is used to help reduce resources usage, such as data storage space or transmission capacity. 
### 
Compression and File Size
The difference is the size of the svg file is less than the compression file. They have 4 kb in differences. 
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes: The attributes of the Shark Class are swim and be_awesome.
### Methods: The methods of the Shark Class are self and name.
### Constructor:The purpose of the  Constructor  is to initialize data. 
### Class vs. Object. a Class is a template for objects; however an object is a member or an instance of a class.
Instantiate an object from a class means that you define one particular variation of object within a class, giving it a name.

## Executive Summary
In this Chapter we will examine the fundamental concepts related to relational and various types of databases. 
Compare and contrast: Data, Information and Knowledge. What are primary keys, Relationship between table,
explain What is a foreign key. We will explore the database language SQL. Practice building SQL statements to retrieve and examine the security 
threats posed by SQL injections. Also explore the database language SQL, key ethical and legal implications in the discipline 
of information systems. Explain RDBMS and how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL. 

## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data transfors into information by assigning a meaning or context to a date. Futhermore, the accumulation of a date bundle represent information. 
The the moment the information is processed, linked and stored, it becomes knowledge.

### Relational Data
#### Primary Key: are Customers ID and Oders number
#### Relationship between customers and orders: The relationship with the customers and oders will be the customers ID to several order Number.
#### Foreign key of orders table: The foreign key of oders table is the customers ID.
### Field Data Types
It is important to properly define the data type of a field to determine what kind of data the field can store. Choosing the right data improves
data integrity by ensuring that the correct data is stored within a data base.

### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
The four "Vs" of the big data are: Volume which is the characteristic of the data itself. Variety is the requirement specific traitement for each piece of data.
Veracity means greater uncertainty about the quality of that data and its availability. Velocity is the were the information has to be generated and managed.
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
The types of technology that have driven the increased need for big data are: Artificial intelligence, NoSQL, R Programming, Data Lakes, Prescriptive  Analytics.

## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
RDBMS is a relational database managment software. RDBMS is relates to SQL by using SQL for manipulation of databases. The purpose of SQL is to let you access and manipulate databases.
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys

## SQL Injections
SQL Injections are a security Threat because it can result in confidential data being deleted, lost or stolen,websites being defaced,
unauthorized access to systems or accounts and, ultimatel, compromize of individual machines of entire networks.
To reduce such threats you can use SQL parameters. SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.

## Ethical and Legal Implications
### Code of Ethics
The purpose of a "code of ethics is to set out organition's ethical guidelines and best practices to follow for honesty, integrity, and professionalism.
THe AMC created the code of ethics to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way.
### Intellectual Property
 The role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property is to help a business to differenciate what they make, do or sell from their competitor's offerings.
 It isimportant to copyright the svg image created because with my logo my business will  be recognize and attractive to consumers through the use of my exclusive logo, and no other will be permitted to use my logo. 
### Information Collection
The way COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet is: The students records in their program are not health recordswhen the program is administered by an Education Agency(EA), but because clinicians also use some of their programs, they have added extra levels of confidentiality protection that are not used by other social-emotional learning programs, this include: Protection within the Software, The Data Location, Privacy Protection with their Cloud-based Server, and Internal policies limit unauthorized access to student data.

## Conclusion
We finally come to the end of this course. I can say, taking this cours was a good start for me on my career path.
Each chapter content covered a lot of knowledge of the IT Program that I am enroll for. Specially This chapter, 
it plays  a big role in the IT systems. First SQL who lets you access and manipulate data, also learning about how to prevent SQL injections
was very helpful. At the end as an IT Students I was glad to learn aboud the code ethics, that helps aware of the rules and guidelines in the IT field.

## Executive Summary
The IT1025 course is intended for students who are pursuing careers in programming, networking and general technology fields. In this course I will learn how to apply knowledge of computer networking and programming concepts, Identify Key Events in Computing History. 
##Information System Components
The five compomnent of the Information Systems are: hardware, sofware, data, people and processes.
As exemple of hardware is a mouse. For sofware we have the operating system. An exemple of Data is a fist name. An network adminstrator is an exemple of people. finally for processes is a program execution. 
## GitHub
Github is a web base interface that use git. The  open source version control sofware  lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere by building and edting their site content at the same time. It also reduces the the risk of duplicative work, and can help decrease production time.
### Client - Server Architecture
A client server architecture is a centralized network achitecture  that clasifies computer into two sections, Client and server. This networking architecture allowed users to log in in to the local area network (LAN) from their PC (The client) by connecting to a central computer called a "Server". Github fits this model by allowing you to input and get Information by using your computer as a client, through the internet as a network to reach out the information located in the github server.  
### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or apersonal computerdelivery of computing. As an exemple Office365 is a sofware as a service.


## Conclusion
As a beginner, I feel that I have a good start with the IT1025 course I already known about the history of IBM. How its contibution play a role in the developplement of the contribution system. More of that now, I know how to use Github eventhough I
 had trouble understand it at the first time, but I finally Catch it up by wacthing the posted video that Professor Herceg left for us on Blackboard. I am looking forward to learn and explore more, because I found it very interesting and helpful.

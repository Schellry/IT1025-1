## Executive Summary 
Include your executive summary here...
This the second week of this course and we are in the second chapter which is mostly about information system hardware.
I feel verey confident on my learning. I am doing getting more confortable with the IT terms. 

## Hardware
Hardware are all the physical component of the computer like keyboard, mouse, cpu, hard drive and monitor.
### Hard Drives and Memory
They both considere as input and ouput system in the digital devices. Both the hard drive and Ram are used for storing data. the RAM is typycally smaller than the hard drive.
The data storin ram are temporary. They erase when the computer shut down. But in the hard drive the data gets stored permanently. 
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Between both Latency and Tranfert Rate the in the performance of a hard drive is: for latency is the the time it takes for data to be transferred between its original source and its destination, yet transfert rates is the speed at which data is tranfered to and from the disk media and is afonction ofthe recording frequency.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
The difference between a Solid State and Hard Drives is how data is stored and accessed. A hard drives is a traditional storage device that uses mechanical platters and a  movind read/write head to access data. A solid state is a newer,faster type of device that sotores data on instantly- accessible memory chips.
#### Random Access Memory
Random Access Memory is a physical memory who keeps the information temporary in the digital devices. Ram gives application a place to store and access data on a short-term basis. It store the information your computer is actively using so that it can be accessed quickly.The tranfert is much faster in the Ram than the Hard drives.
### ALU and the Control Unit
ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit which is carries out basic arithmatic and logic operations. It is a memory unit, and input/output(I/O) controllers. 
### CPU, Input & Output
The CPU is the brain of the computer. The CPU carries out the commands sent to it by the sofware and returns results to be acted upon. 
Input are all data a computer receive and output is data that a computer sents.
### Logic Gates 
Logic gates perform basic logical functions and are the fundamental building blocks of digital integrated circuits. Usually, they take an input of two binary values, and output a single value of a 1 or 0.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE- Pronounced as Eye-triple-E is an association dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity. It is the world's largest technical professional society. It is designed to serve professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing field and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilisation. 
Ethically Aligned Design is a vision for prioritizing human well-being with autonomous and intelligent systems.
## Data Representation
Data representation refers to the form in which data is stored, processed, and transmited information such as text, numbers, photos or music, into data that can be manipulated by electronics devices.
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal number system use a base of 10, Binary base is 2, and hexadecimal uses a base of 16.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
The #ab00ff is composed of 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue is pure or mostly pur violet. The hexadecimal color #ab00ff has RGB values of R:171, G:0, B:225 and CMYK values of C: 33, M:1, Y:o, K:0. Its decimal value is 11206911.
## Conclusion
I hav learned alot about hardware like the CPU which is the brain of the computer, the primary components of a computer and the fonctions that they performs. I also know the effect of the commmoditization of the personal computer. I am able to do some conversion from binary to decimal and vice versa. This course is very improtant for my career. The IT field is urge and interresting.I am expected to leran alot more.

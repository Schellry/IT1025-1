### Executive Summary
This project was about co-op which is a program to help students gaining practical experience in their field of study prior to graduation. Through this program, students are able to alternate academic study with full time employment. This project was helpful on taking the next step in my career path. It helped me create a resume and submitted it
to the career center for review and helped me edited my resume in a professional standard. After that, I had a chance to participate in the co-op orientation process through 
the career center. This process also included a final resume revisions and approval by a career coach at College Central Network. One last step was completing and signing of the Cooperative Education Agreement form.

Describe the process you will take to become co-op ready (include dates of seminars you will plan if you elect Option 1 OR, a brief description of the project you plan to implement (programming, research etc.)
I have 5 steps to take to become a co-op ready.   1) I have to Complete the "Co-op Student Application of Interest" form and submit it to the career center. 
                                                  2) Follow-up with the career center to schedule a resume review.
                                                  3)  Participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center including three workshops and a resume review.
                                                  4)  Upload your resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at College Central Network. 
                                                  5)  Complete and sign a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form.  

### Project Part 2:

If you elected option 1 describe the process you followed to become co-op ready and the name of your career coach OR, for option 2, present your program, application, reach etc.  There is no specific guidelines on the length or development success.  Some students plan on creating an app and find that they only got to determining the full purpose, outcomes and technology which is fine.  The purpose of the project is to take a topic of particular interest to you and spend some more time to gain a deeper level of understanding.

First thing that I have to do to become a co-op ready was to Participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center.
After I finish with the orientation, I Uploaded my resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at Handshake.
Then with the collaboration of an Employer Relations Specialist, I applied and interviewed with approved co-op placements.
Finally I completed and signed a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form and registered for college credit Internships.
